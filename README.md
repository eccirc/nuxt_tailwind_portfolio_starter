# portfolio_template_blank

## SPA (somewhat rough but functional!) starter template for portfolio site - visual artist, photogrpaher etc. built with nuxt.js and tailwind CSS
# Includes basic navbar, item scoll with IntersectionObserver API for fade on scroll, and a basic lightbox-type modal overlay


# This could be a starting point for setting up with a headless CMS with Git continuous deployment.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
